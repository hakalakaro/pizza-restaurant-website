# pizza-restaurant-website
This is a fullstack project to create a website for a pizza restaurant. The site aims to be fully functional restaurant website where user can create account, login and complete their online order. The site has a login system that uses PHP and a database. Passwords are hashed.

After creating account, user can login with his/her username and password. Logging in enables new tabs for the user to see, like "order now" and "my profile". In "my profile", the user can see his/her account information and order history.

The site also has a contact form where user can send feedback. 

Currently the ordering is not possible, but in the next update there will be a way to put items in the shopping cart and take the transaction all the way to the payment process. 

Techniques used in this project are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP.
